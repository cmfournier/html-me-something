                <p id="description"> My first professional job was working as an agate clerk covering
                    high school sports for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. This was
                    a fun job that primarily combined data entry with writing and
                    editing.

                    This was a very short-lived job, but it was significant because
                    I was working as a technical recruiter. This exposed me to
                    the world of programming, development, and database technologies.

                    This is where my professional interest in more technical pursuits
                    began to take shape. I started out managing a data entry team on an
                    AS400 database. Eventually I helped oversee a database migration
                    to a web-based CRM system and became more interested in how databases
                    work.

                    This is where I currently work. I analyze a lot of transactional data from our database
                    using SQL, and I also select and extract large datasets to send direct mailings to members of our database. 
                    When I started working here, we were again using an AS400 database. However,
                    as of last year, we have migrated to a CRM platform. I've had to learn the hard way
                    that different databases and CRMs can be structured much differently, and that the SQL
                    needed to traverse the tables can be far different from one database to another.
